      <p>I like travelling world .there are some planning measures you want to take first to ensure you have durable luggage and the proper documents 
      Working while traveling can be tricky, but there are a few steps you can take that donâ€™t involve quitting your job to travel the world.Start by saving vacation days if you work at a company that pays out for these dates. Those looking to trade in vacation days can also check out companies like PTO Exchange, which lets companies buy back unused vacation days so employees can convert these days into travel, health benefits or charity credits.</p>
